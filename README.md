A simple raytracer based on *"Raytracing in One Weekend"* series by P. Shirley ([Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B5AODD8)).
Mostly useful for profiling/optimization tests.

It gave me the excuse i needed to start my own util functions/math library and to play with OpenMP. Cuda is coming next.


Tracing is not yet visible in realtime, but i added a cute progress bar so
you can estimate how many coffees you can drink before work has finished.

This is an example of CornellBox tracing. I added some spheres with different
materials to make result more interesting
